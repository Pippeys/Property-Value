in your data set you are gonna have a bunch of points in at each year bin

```{r eval = T, echo = T}
plot(fake$year, fake$z_price, type = "l")
```
# in ggplot (my pref)
```{r eval = T, echo = T}
ggplot(fake,aes(x = year, y = z_price)) +
  geom_point()
```
# with LM
```{r eval = T, echo = T}
ggplot(fake,aes(x = year, y = z_price)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F)
